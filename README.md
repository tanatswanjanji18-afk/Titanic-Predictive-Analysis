Predictive Analysis of the Titanic survival rates using machine learning.
# Titanic Survival Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning. We explore factors influencing survival and build predictive models with >80% accuracy.

**Project Business Questions:**
1. What demographic factors most affected survival chances?
2. Which machine learning model predicts survival most accurately?
3. What actionable insights can inform future safety protocols?
